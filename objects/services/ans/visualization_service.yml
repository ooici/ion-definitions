# Visualization service interface definition

name: visualization_service

docstring: The Visualization Service is responsible for creating transform processes for the data products available in the system and also provides access to the resulting viz products. (e.g Google DataTables, Matplotlib graphs, etc)

dependencies: [resource_registry, pubsub_management, transform_management]
