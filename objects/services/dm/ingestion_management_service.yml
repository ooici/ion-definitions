# Ingestion Management Service interface definition

name: ingestion_management_service

docstring: |
    The Ingestion service provides operations to setup data ingestion workers and the ingestion policy for each stream.
    The actual processing of data and metadata occurs in an ingestion worker process, not the ingestion service.
