  create_association:
    docstring: |
      Create an association between subject and object resources (IonObjects).

      Subject and object must be of the proper types for the predicate or
      an exception will be thrown.
      Assoc_type determines the type of the association. If not specified, uses
      the default "H2H". The possible values are H2H, H2R, R2H, R2R, where "H" stands
      for an association to the head revision and "R" stands for an association
      to a specific revision.
