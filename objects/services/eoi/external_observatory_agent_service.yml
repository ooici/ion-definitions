name: external_observatory_agent

docstring: |
   One service representing multiple external sources and data sets.

   NOTE:  At this point, the functions below the "#From ResourceAgent" comment are copied directly
   from the ResourceAgent interface definition (ion-definitions/objects/services/resource_agent.yml).
   Ultimately, this service should really inherit from or be a subclass of ResourceAgent.
   It is currently unclear how this should happen, but one suggestion is to have the concrete
   implementation use multiple-inheritance, for example:

     class ExternalObservatoryAgentService(BaseExternalObservatoryAgentService, ResourceAgent):

spec: https://confluence.oceanobservatories.org/display/syseng/CIAD+DM+OV+External+Observatory+Agent+Service

dependencies: [resource_registry]
